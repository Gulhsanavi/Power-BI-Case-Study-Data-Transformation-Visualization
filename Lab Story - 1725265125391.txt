Task 3: Configure the Region table

	Salesperson | EmployeeKey

	Salesperson | UPN

	SalespersonRegion | EmployeeKey

	SalespersonRegion | SalesTerritoryKey

	Targets | EmployeeID
	
Task 7: Notice How there are auto Created heirarchies on Date, looks fine ? 
	Yes but there is a problem PowerBI automatically starts the financial year from Jan 1 . 
	But this might differ with client, here in india we start financial year from Apr 1. so the heirarchies will not be valid wrt Qtrs
	Disable this behaviour.
	We will create our own Date Table later on

Task 8: Create Custom Measures using Quick Measures in the sales table
	1. Profit = Sales - Cost
	2. Profit Margin = Profit / Sales
