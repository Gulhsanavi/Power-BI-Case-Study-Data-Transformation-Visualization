With these, Student will learn how to :

	Apply various transformations

	Apply queries to load them to the data model


Note: TO make sure that we are all in unity , use the exact same columns as mentioned below

Task 1: Configure DimEmployee
	
	1.Rename the query to "Salesperson"
	2.Filter the data so that only the Sales Employees are part of the table ( Use SalesPersonFlag Column )
	3.Too many columns make the pipeline slower and the data not easy to intepret. Only Keep these columns, remove the other. 
		EmployeeKey
		EmployeeNationalIDAlternateKey
		FirstName
		LastName
		Title
		EmailAddress
	4.Create a Single Name column called "SalesPerson" combining the First Name and Last Name Columns
	5.Rename columns:
		a."EmployeeNationalIDAlternateKey" to "EmployeeID"
		b."EmailAddress" to "UPN"

Task 2: Configure DimProduct query

	1.Rename the query to "Products"
	2.Remove DimProductSubcategory and FactInternetSales columns
	
Task 3: Configure DimProduct query

	1.Rename the query to Product
	2.Only Keep products that are finished ( Filter on the Finished Goods Columns)
	3.Keep only the following columns
		ProductKey
		EnglishProductName
		StandardCost
		Color
		DimProductSubcategory
	4.Connect to the DimProductCategory Table using the DimProductSubCategory value link, 
	expand the table and get only these columns 
( Note: Do not use ColumnNamePrefix, as there are no duplicate col names )
		
		EnglishProductSubcategoryName
		DimProductCategory 

	5. Observe that DimProductCategory column itself is a table. Expand that as well and only fetch the EnglishProductCategoryName colum

	6. Rename the columns as follows 
	
		EnglishProductName to "Product"
		StandardCost to "Standard Cost" 
		EnglishProductSubcategoryName to "Subcategory"
		EnglishProductCategoryName to "Category"

Task 4: Configure the DimReseller query

	1.Rename the query to Reseller
	2.Keep only the following columns
		ResellerKey
		BusinessType
		ResellerName
		DimGeography

	3.Connect to the DimGeography column and include only the following
		City
		StateProvinceName
		EnglishCountryRegionName

	4.Rename the columns as follows 
	
		BusinessType to Business Type (include a space)
		ResellerName to Reseller
		StateProvinceName to State-Province
		EnglishCountryRegionName to Country-Region

	5.Notice the Duplicate warehouse category in the Business Type Column.Correct it using the Replace Values option.

Task 5: Configure the DimSalesTerritory query

	1.Rename the query to Region 
	2.Exclude the corporate HQ record in the data. You can filter on salesTerritoryAlternateKey to exclude 0
	3.Keep only the following columns
		SalesTerritoryKey
		SalesTerritoryRegion
		SalesTerritoryCountry
		SalesTerritoryGroup
	4.Rename the columns as follows 
	
		SalesTerritoryRegion to Region
		SalesTerritoryCountry to Country
		SalesTerritoryGroup to Group

Task 6: Configure the FactReseller Sales query

	1.Rename the query to Sales
	2.Keep only the following columns
		SalesOrderNumber
		OrderDate
		ProductKey
		ResellerKey
		EmployeeKey
		SalesTerritoryKey
		OrderQuantity
		UnitPrice
		TotalProductCost
		SalesAmount
		DimProduct
	(Recall that a small percentage of FactResellerSales rows had missing TotalProductCost values. 
	The DimProduct column has been included to retrieve the product standard cost, to fix the missing values)
	
	3.Create a new custom column called "Cost", use the standard cost in the DimProduct table with
	null values in TotalProductCost set to [OrderQuantity] * [StandardCost]
	
	Use this formula:
		if [TotalProductCost] = null then [OrderQuantity] * [StandardCost] else [TotalProductCost]

	4. Drop the TotalProductCost and StandardCost columns.

	5.Rename the following three columns:
		OrderQuantity to Quantity
		UnitPrice to Unit Price (include a space)
		SalesAmount to Sales

	6.Change Datatypes of Columns as follows
		quantity - > Whole Number
		Unit Price,Sales and Cost -> Fixed Decimal Number

Task 7: Configure the ResellerSalesTargets query
	1.Rename the query to Targets
	2.Unpivot the 12-month columns (M01-M12), name the new column as MonthNumber (hint: transform tab)
	3.filter out the records with '-' Hyphen 
	4.Change the Dtype to whole Number, ( remember to use replace values first on the column)
	5. Use the "Custom Column from Example" Feature to  Get a date column Called "TargetMonth" 
		with first day of the months , according to the MonthNumber Column
	6.Change Datatypes of Columns as follows
		Target Month - > Date
		Target -> Fixed Decimal Number
	7. Multiply the target values column by 1000 ( Use the transform tab in the ribbon )

Task 8: Configure the ColorFormats query
	1.Check if the column headers are correct and fix the issue
	2.Merge the ColorFormats Query to the Product table and expand the columns
		NOTE:
			Privacy levels can be configured for data source to determine whether data can be 
			shared between sources. Setting each data source as Organizational allows them to 
			share data, if necessary. Note that Private data sources can never be shared with 
			other data sources. It doesnâ€™t mean that Private data cannot be shared; it means 
			that the Power Query engine cannot share data between the sources.
	3.Now since the colorformats is unneccasary disable its load to the report ( untoggle the "Enable load to report" checkbox)


Wrapping Up:

Press Close and Apply, loading the dataset to the report
